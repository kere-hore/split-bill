# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Slack webhook integration as a group communication platform and enhanced caching system for the Split Bill application. The Slack integration will send bill notifications, settlement reminders, and group updates directly to configured Slack channels, mentioning relevant group members. The cache enhancement will improve performance monitoring and management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Split Bill group member, I want to receive Slack notifications in my group's channel when bills are added or settlements occur, so that I can stay updated on group expenses and payments without checking the app constantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new bill is added to a group THEN the system SHALL send a Slack notification to the configured channel mentioning all group members
2. WHEN a settlement is recorded THEN the system SHALL send a Slack notification mentioning the payer and receiver
3. WHEN a group member owes money THEN the system SHALL mention them in settlement reminder notifications
4. WHEN bill details are shared THEN the system SHALL include expense breakdown and individual amounts owed
5. IF a group has no configured Slack channel THEN the system SHALL skip Slack notifications for that group
6. IF Slack webhook fails THEN the system SHALL log the error without blocking the main operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a group administrator, I want to configure Slack channel integration for my Split Bill group, so that my group members can receive notifications in our existing Slack workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a group THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of Slack webhook URL and channel
2. WHEN Slack integration is enabled for a group THEN the system SHALL validate webhook URL and channel accessibility
3. WHEN multiple groups use different Slack channels THEN the system SHALL send notifications to the correct channel for each group
4. IF Slack configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL show validation errors and disable Slack for that group
5. WHEN Slack integration is disabled for a group THEN the system SHALL stop sending notifications to that channel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced cache monitoring and analytics, so that I can optimize application performance and troubleshoot caching issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL track hit/miss ratios with detailed metrics
2. WHEN cache invalidation happens THEN the system SHALL log invalidation reasons and affected keys
3. WHEN cache performance degrades THEN the system SHALL send alerts via Slack
4. IF cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
5. WHEN cache analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive performance reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Split Bill group member, I want to receive well-formatted Slack notifications with clear expense details and member mentions, so that I can quickly understand what I owe and to whom.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending bill notifications THEN the system SHALL format messages with expense details, amounts, and split breakdown
2. WHEN mentioning group members THEN the system SHALL use proper Slack user mentions (@username) based on user mapping
3. WHEN settlement notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL clearly show who paid whom and remaining balances
4. WHEN bill summaries are shared THEN the system SHALL include public links for detailed views
5. IF user mapping fails THEN the system SHALL use display names instead of mentions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want cache warming and preloading capabilities, so that I can ensure optimal performance during peak usage times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL warm critical cache entries
2. WHEN new groups are created THEN the system SHALL preload related cache entries
3. WHEN cache warming is triggered THEN the system SHALL prioritize frequently accessed data
4. IF cache warming fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with normal operations
5. WHEN cache preloading completes THEN the system SHALL report success metrics via Slack

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring for both Slack webhooks and cache operations, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Slack webhooks are sent THEN the system SHALL log request/response details
2. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error logs with context
4. IF monitoring thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts
5. WHEN system health checks run THEN the system SHALL report status via multiple channels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Split Bill user, I want the system to automatically map my account to my Slack user, so that I can be properly mentioned in group notifications without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins a group with Slack integration THEN the system SHALL attempt to map the user to a Slack user ID
2. WHEN mapping users THEN the system SHALL first try to match by email address for highest accuracy
3. IF email matching fails THEN the system SHALL attempt fuzzy matching by display name or username
4. WHEN user mapping is successful THEN the system SHALL store the mapping for future notifications
5. IF user mapping fails THEN the system SHALL use display name in notifications and log the mapping failure
6. WHEN user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL re-attempt user mapping with new information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a group member, I want to receive different types of Slack notifications based on my involvement in expenses, so that I only get relevant notifications and avoid spam.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bill affects me (I owe money or paid) THEN the system SHALL mention me in the notification
2. WHEN a bill doesn't affect me THEN the system SHALL include me in general group notifications without direct mention
3. WHEN someone pays me THEN the system SHALL mention me in the settlement notification
4. WHEN I pay someone THEN the system SHALL mention both me and the recipient
5. WHEN group summaries are sent THEN the system SHALL mention all active group members

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a group administrator, I want to manually map Split Bill group members to their Slack usernames through a settings interface, so that I can ensure accurate mentions even when automatic mapping fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing group Slack settings THEN the system SHALL display all group members with their current mapping status
2. WHEN a member is not automatically mapped THEN the system SHALL provide a manual mapping interface
3. WHEN manually mapping a user THEN the system SHALL allow input of Slack user ID or @username
4. WHEN saving manual mappings THEN the system SHALL validate Slack usernames and show confirmation
5. WHEN a manual mapping is invalid THEN the system SHALL show error messages and prevent saving
6. WHEN mappings are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately use new mappings for future notifications

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a group administrator, I want to specify custom Slack channels for different notification types, so that I can organize group communications effectively (e.g., bills in #expenses, settlements in #payments).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Slack integration THEN the system SHALL allow specification of default channel and per-notification-type channels
2. WHEN setting custom channels THEN the system SHALL support both channel names (#channel) and direct messages (@user)
3. WHEN multiple channels are configured THEN the system SHALL send each notification type to its designated channel
4. WHEN a custom channel is not specified THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default channel
5. WHEN channel configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL show validation errors and prevent saving
6. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL send test messages to all configured channels
